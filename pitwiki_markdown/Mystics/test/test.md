**Welcome** to Pit Wiki editing in a modified version of [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)! We hope you find this easier than editing the raw HTML text.

Here's some new features that PitMarkdown has that Markdown doesn't:
- **Easy-to-add special links**, like [XP], [gold], and [renown]. [Prestiging](Prestige) requires [65,950 XP|xp]. The [Barbarian](Perks#Barbarian) axe deals 4[heart] of damage.
- **Color codes** using curly brackets: { and \}. They follow the standard Minecraft order, starting at {0|black}. {1|Then,} {2|they} {3|move} {4|between} {5|every} {6|color} {7|code} {8|in} {9|between}, {a|sixteen} {b|in} {c|total}, {d|before} {e|reaching} {f|white}. Custom color codes can be added with a hex code, such as {F8B1F1|this}. True damage is {td|also here}.

If you need to insert regular HTML tags, you can do that as well. <span class="subheader">**Markdown** still works inside them!</span> HTML entities, such as &uarr; and &star;, also work.

Images can be easily made in a table on the right with [box]. The arguments are as follows:
1. Width of box (roughly the % of the screen)
2. Image location
3. Width of image (typically `100` or `50`)
4. Caption (optional&mdash;leave this out if you don't want one!)

Tables are supported, too; they're just like regular Markdown.
|Name|Description|Cost|
|---|---|---|
|Flameborn|Sets your sword ablaze, dealing {c|+50% damage} every hit.|[50 renown\|renown]|
|Frosted Fury|Tips your arrows in ice, giving players Slowness II (0:04) on contact.|[5,000,000g\|gold]|
